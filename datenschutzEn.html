    <h2>2. Purpose and Scope of Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
      We process any information you provide (e.g. name, email address, message)
      solely to respond to your inquiry. There is no further usage, for example
      for marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>3. No Long-Term Storage</h2>
    <p>
      We do not permanently store your data in a separate database.
      Communication normally takes place by email and remains there only 
      for as long as necessary to respond to your inquiry.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      We do not disclose your data to third parties unless there is a legal obligation
      to do so (e.g. an official request).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security and Encryption</h2>
    <p>
      Email communication typically takes place unencrypted.
      This means emails may potentially be viewed by unauthorized persons
      on the internet during transmission. 
      If you wish to avoid this risk,
      please contact us by telephone or postal mail.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Erasure of Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      Once your inquiry has been addressed and there are no legal retention periods,
      your data will be deleted or anonymized.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> You have the right to request information about the personal data we process about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Rectification &amp; Erasure:</strong> You may request the correction of inaccurate data or the deletion of your data, provided there is no legal obligation to retain it.</li>
      <li><strong>Objection:</strong> You may object to data processing at any time, especially if you do not wish to communicate unencrypted via email.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      For questions about data processing or to exercise your rights,
      please email us at job.werke@web.de
      (or contact us by phone or postal mail).
